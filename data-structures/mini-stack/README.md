# Mini Stack Progragam

This program uses a stack to read input and process it using a Last in First Out structure.
Running the program will process three different utilities for using a stack:
- The first accepts user input to read the chars of two strings and determines if the input is a palindrome.
- The second accepts user input to convert a decimal number to hexidecimal format.
- The third reads a text file that checks if a the parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets are balanced throughout a file.
